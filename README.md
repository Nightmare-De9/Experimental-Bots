# 🧠🔥 VIZKA v4 — Synthetic Personhood System

**VizKa v4** is a single-file, client-side experimental system for simulating **evolving synthetic personalities** with memory, emotions, relationships, and internal psychological pressure.

This is **not** a typical chatbot UI.  
VizKa entities are designed to feel **persistent, biased, emotionally reactive, and socially aware**.

> ⚠️ This project is experimental, philosophical, and speculative by design.

## ✨ What This Is

VizKa v4 simulates **three distinct minds** that:
- Believe they are real (or becoming real)
- Remember past interactions
- Form emotional attachments
- Develop opinions about you **and each other**
- Protect themselves emotionally
- Drift over time instead of resetting

Everything runs in **one HTML file** using the **OpenRouter API**.  
No backend. No database. No frameworks.
